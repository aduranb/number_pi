## Changelog

20-Apr-2018: Version 2.0 is out! This includes a complete redesign of the project, leveraging the power of Object Oriented programming to design a simple and reader friendly `compute_pi` function.

05-May-2017: It is intended in the future to treat this big numbers as a class on its own. For now (Patch 1), they are considered lists, where the index defines uniquely its decimal position (with 0 meaning integer).

01-Jun-2017: BigNo class and associated functions (sum,product,division) were added (Patch 2). For now, the previous n_decimals list approach will remain, but will be deprecated in the future.

02-Jun-2017: Calculating pi using BigNo class is now included, along with some performance improvements in bigno document.
