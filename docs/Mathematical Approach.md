# Mathematical Approach

It's taken as a given that π can be reduced as the infinite sum of a series of terms generated by the following formula:
```python
euler_term = (factorial(n)**2)*(2**(n+1)) / (factorial(2*n +1))
```
This corresponds to plugging `x=1/sqrt(2)` into the hypergeometric function 2F1(a;b;c;x), and it's an improvement from a previous approach discovered by Leibniz, known as the  [Gregory series](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GregorySeries.html):
```python
leibniz_term = 4 * (-1)**(n + 1) / (2*n + 1)
```
This can be obtained by inserting `x=1` in the Taylor approximation series of  tan^(-1)x. The error after the n-th term is larger than 2n, which means that the series converges so slowly that 300 terms are not sufficient to calculate  π correctly to two decimal places.

The euler transformation is a technique for series convergence improvement which, when applied to the Gregory series, the series now converges at one bit per term.
Proof of this mathematical achievement (by Leonard Euler), can be found [here](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulerTransform.html) for completeness.
