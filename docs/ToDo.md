A set of tasks that would enhance or complete the functionality provided by this project.

- Add "less than" or "less or equal than" dunder methods to LongDecimal.
- Add common operations (division, substraction, product) dunder methods to LongDecimal.
- Negative numbers don't get correctly allocated their sign when defined as LongDecimal().as_quotient.
- Most of the modern computations of pi use series that include square roots in the terms. A functionality to calculate square roots to LongDecimal must then be added.
