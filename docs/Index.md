The content of this project is both a mathematical challenge and a programming one.

## Mathematical approach

Ï€ can be reduced as the infinite sum of a series of terms generated by the following formula:
```python
euler_term = (factorial(n)**2)*(2**(n+1)) / (factorial(2*n +1))
```

## Project architecture
The project uses Object Oriented programming to come up with a simple and easy to read `compute_pi` function.

```python
    while not euler_term.iszero():

          pi = pi + euler_term

          term += 1

          euler_term = LongDecimalEuler(term=term)
    return pi
```

A new class called `LongDecimal` has been defined, with the float properties needed, and a class `LongDecimalEuler`, which inherits from `LongDecimal`, is defined as terms of the Euler series used to compute pi.

The function `compute_pi()` takes the desired number of decimals as an argument, and returns the value of pi in the form of a `LongDecimal`, which can be printed as a normal float (but with any desired precision).
