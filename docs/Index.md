The content of this project is both a mathematical challenge and a programming one.

## Mathematical approach

Ï€ can be reduced as the infinite sum of a series of terms generated by the following formula:
```python
euler_term = (factorial(n)**2)*(2**(n+1)) / (factorial(2*n +1))
```
>You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/ohduran/number_pi/blob/master/docs/Mathematical%20Approach.md).

## Project architecture
The project uses Object Oriented programming to come up with a simple and easy to read `compute_pi` function.

```python
    while not euler_term.iszero():

          pi = pi + euler_term

          term += 1

          euler_term = LongDecimalEuler(term=term)
      return pi
```
